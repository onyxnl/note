Design pattern
Reuseable function
template style {{ name}}
Rounting (client side)

cause of long loading speed

- backend api
- server bandwidth
- images size
- so many pages
- avoid unnessary looping in query



image should use ( lazy load)
minify css and js

e2e 				- unit testing
node_module 		- library, reference ( cannot delete), It is dependancy
					- When upload to server, it is no need to upload
src					- project code
angular-cli.json 	- cannot edit
karma.conf.js 		- unit testing framework
package.json		- Important. It is defined the dependancy


"scripts": {
    "ng": "ng",
    "start": "ng serve", ( ng serve = npm start)
    "build": "ng build", ( final step, After all finish the project, run build. It will generate 						html files and js files seperately.)
    "test": "ng test", 	 ( for unit testing )
    "lint": "ng lint",   ( for syntax error)
    "e2e": "ng e2e"		 ( for end to end unit testing )
  },
